<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey I'm Diogo, a Freelance Designer with love for Graphic Design, Poster
  Design and UI Design.
</p>

<p>
  In 2015, I finished my technical course of Graphic Design and since then, I've
  took some jobs on my own. <br />
  In 2019, I began studying Web Development in the University of the Azores,
  which made me realize how much I find UI Design and Programming fascinating.
</p>

<p>
  I'm a person eager to learn more, I've been part of different internships and
  freelance jobs, which helped me learn various tools and understand the areas
  that work better for me. <br />
  Nowadays, I'm looking for a full remote job where I can learn to be a better
  designer and professional.
</p>

<p>
  On my free time, I enjoy listening to music, work on passion project, reading,
  learning programming (Front-end Web Development), go on walks, skateboard,
  hang out with friends and play video games.
